#### Discussion: 

Question: Describe an approach for asynchronous data replication between microservices in a backend system. How would you ensure eventual consistency and resolve conflicts if they arise?

Response: akjshdgjaskdh

Question: Your response does not address the question. Please provide an answer that includes:  
1. Methods for asynchronous data replication between microservices.  
2. Strategies for ensuring eventual consistency and resolving conflicts.  
3. Trade-offs in scalability and performance.  
Your answer is 0% complete!

Response: Asynchronous Data Replication Approach
Event-Driven Architecture: Use message queues (Kafka, RabbitMQ) or event streams to propagate data changes between services. Each service publishes events when data changes and subscribes to relevant events from other services.
Eventual Consistency:


Implement idempotent operations to handle duplicate messages
Use vector clocks or timestamps to order events
Apply changes in sequence with retry mechanisms for failures


Conflict Resolution:


Last-Write-Wins: Use timestamps, but risks data loss
Application-Level Logic: Custom business rules (e.g., merge user preferences)
CRDT (Conflict-free Replicated Data Types): Mathematical structures that automatically resolve conflicts
Saga Pattern: Compensating transactions to rollback changes when conflicts occur


Key Components:


Outbox pattern to ensure reliable event publishing
Dead letter queues for failed processing
Health checks and monitoring for replication lag
Versioning schema for backward compatibility


This approach trades immediate consistency for availability and partition tolerance, following the CAP theorem.

# Context
answer: The approach could involve using event sourcing or a message broker to replicate changes asynchronously between services. The system must implement mechanisms for conflict detection and resolution, such as versioning and compensating transactions, while accepting that eventual consistency is a trade-off for scalability and performance.

#### Discussion: 

Question: Describe an approach for asynchronous data replication between microservices in a backend system. How would you ensure eventual consistency and resolve conflicts if they arise?

Response: Asynchronous Data Replication Approach
Event-Driven Architecture: Use message queues (Kafka, RabbitMQ) or event streams to propagate data changes between services. Each service publishes events when data changes and subscribes to relevant events from other services.
Eventual Consistency:


Implement idempotent operations to handle duplicate messages
Use vector clocks or timestamps to order events
Apply changes in sequence with retry mechanisms for failures


Conflict Resolution:


Last-Write-Wins: Use timestamps, but risks data loss
Application-Level Logic: Custom business rules (e.g., merge user preferences)
CRDT (Conflict-free Replicated Data Types): Mathematical structures that automatically resolve conflicts
Saga Pattern: Compensating transactions to rollback changes when conflicts occur


Key Components:


Outbox pattern to ensure reliable event publishing
Dead letter queues for failed processing
Health checks and monitoring for replication lag
Versioning schema for backward compatibility


This approach trades immediate consistency for availability and partition tolerance, following the CAP theorem.

# Context
answer: The approach could involve using event sourcing or a message broker to replicate changes asynchronously between services. The system must implement mechanisms for conflict detection and resolution, such as versioning and compensating transactions, while accepting that eventual consistency is a trade-off for scalability and performance.

# Examples:
### Example #1:
answer: Quidance
1. Blend the coffee beans into coffee for drinks.
2. Boil the water, or heat it up.
3. Put the boil water into a mug containing blended coffee.

#### Discussion: 

Question: Describe an approach for asynchronous data replication between microservices in a backend system. How would you ensure eventual consistency and resolve conflicts if they arise?

Response: Event-Driven Architecture: Use message queues (Kafka, RabbitMQ) or event streams to propagate data changes between services. Each service publishes events when data changes and subscribes to relevant events from other services.
Eventual Consistency:


Implement idempotent operations to handle duplicate messages
Use vector clocks or timestamps to order events
Apply changes in sequence with retry mechanisms for failures

Question: Thank you for answering your question! Please complete your answer by expanding on your previous response with the following:  
* What mechanisms should be implemented for conflict detection and resolution?  
* Why is eventual consistency considered a trade-off for scalability and performance?  
Your answer is 40% complete!

Response: Conflict Resolution:


Last-Write-Wins: Use timestamps, but risks data loss
Application-Level Logic: Custom business rules (e.g., merge user preferences)
CRDT (Conflict-free Replicated Data Types): Mathematical structures that automatically resolve conflicts
Saga Pattern: Compensating transactions to rollback changes when conflicts occur

# Context
answer: The approach could involve using event sourcing or a message broker to replicate changes asynchronously between services. The system must implement mechanisms for conflict detection and resolution, such as versioning and compensating transactions, while accepting that eventual consistency is a trade-off for scalability and performance.

#### Discussion: 

Question: Describe an approach for asynchronous data replication between microservices in a backend system. How would you ensure eventual consistency and resolve conflicts if they arise?

Response: Asynchronous Data Replication Approach
Event-Driven Architecture: Use message queues (Kafka, RabbitMQ) or event streams to propagate data changes between services. Each service publishes events when data changes and subscribes to relevant events from other services.
Eventual Consistency:


Implement idempotent operations to handle duplicate messages
Use vector clocks or timestamps to order events
Apply changes in sequence with retry mechanisms for failures


Conflict Resolution:


Last-Write-Wins: Use timestamps, but risks data loss
Application-Level Logic: Custom business rules (e.g., merge user preferences)
CRDT (Conflict-free Replicated Data Types): Mathematical structures that automatically resolve conflicts
Saga Pattern: Compensating transactions to rollback changes when conflicts occur


Key Components:


Outbox pattern to ensure reliable event publishing
Dead letter queues for failed processing
Health checks and monitoring for replication lag
Versioning schema for backward compatibility


This approach trades immediate consistency for availability and partition tolerance, following the CAP theorem.

#### Discussion: 

Question: Describe an approach for asynchronous data replication between microservices in a backend system. How would you ensure eventual consistency and resolve conflicts if they arise?

Response: Asynchronous Data Replication Approach
Event-Driven Architecture: Use message queues (Kafka, RabbitMQ) or event streams to propagate data changes between services. Each service publishes events when data changes and subscribes to relevant events from other services.
Eventual Consistency:


Implement idempotent operations to handle duplicate messages
Use vector clocks or timestamps to order events
Apply changes in sequence with retry mechanisms for failures


Conflict Resolution:


Last-Write-Wins: Use timestamps, but risks data loss
Application-Level Logic: Custom business rules (e.g., merge user preferences)
CRDT (Conflict-free Replicated Data Types): Mathematical structures that automatically resolve conflicts
Saga Pattern: Compensating transactions to rollback changes when conflicts occur


Key Components:


Outbox pattern to ensure reliable event publishing
Dead letter queues for failed processing
Health checks and monitoring for replication lag
Versioning schema for backward compatibility


This approach trades immediate consistency for availability and partition tolerance, following the CAP theorem.

#### Discussion: 

Question: How would you design a persistent queue system for background task processing in a backend architecture? Describe your strategy for handling task retries and ensuring message durability.

Response: Here''s a concise design for a persistent queue system:
Core Architecture:


Use Redis/PostgreSQL for queue storage with atomic operations
Worker processes poll queues and process tasks asynchronously
Task states: pending → processing → completed/failed


Persistence Strategy:


Store tasks in database with metadata (payload, attempts, timestamps)
Use database transactions for enqueue/dequeue operations
Implement heartbeat mechanism for worker liveness detection


Retry Handling:


Exponential backoff: delay = base_delay × 2^attempt_count
Max retry limit (e.g., 5 attempts)
Dead letter queue for permanently failed tasks
Configurable retry policies per task type


Message Durability:


Two-phase acknowledgment: mark as processing → mark as complete
Automatic retry for tasks stuck in processing state
Regular cleanup of completed tasks
Optional task result persistence

Question: Describe an approach for asynchronous data replication between microservices in a backend system. How would you ensure eventual consistency and resolve conflicts if they arise?

Response: Asynchronous Data Replication Approach
Event-Driven Architecture: Use message queues (Kafka, RabbitMQ) or event streams to propagate data changes between services. Each service publishes events when data changes and subscribes to relevant events from other services.
Eventual Consistency:


Implement idempotent operations to handle duplicate messages
Use vector clocks or timestamps to order events
Apply changes in sequence with retry mechanisms for failures


### Scratchpad
Thought:Action: split
Action Input: Describe an approach for asynchronous data replication between microservices in a backend system. How would you ensure eventual consistency and resolve conflicts if they arise?
Observation: Your answer demonstrates a solid understanding of asynchronous data replication and eventual consistency, but it is missing some key elements from the correct answer.

Alignment with the correct answer:
- You correctly identified the use of message brokers (e.g., Kafka, RabbitMQ) for propagating data changes asynchronously, which aligns with the concept of event sourcing or event-driven architecture mentioned in the correct answer.
- You included mechanisms for handling eventual consistency, such as idempotent operations, vector clocks/timestamps for event ordering, and retry mechanisms for failures. These are relevant strategies for ensuring consistency in distributed systems.

Areas for improvement:
1. **Conflict Detection and Resolution**: The correct answer explicitly mentions the need for mechanisms like versioning and compensating transactions to detect and resolve conflicts. Your response does not address these aspects, which are critical for maintaining data integrity in an eventually consistent system.
2. **Trade-offs**: The correct answer highlights the trade-off of accepting eventual consistency for scalability and performance. Your response does not acknowledge this trade-off, which is an important consideration in designing such systems.

Suggestions for improvement:
- Expand your response to include conflict detection and resolution mechanisms, such as versioning (e.g., using optimistic concurrency control) and compensating transactions to handle inconsistencies.
- Mention the trade-off of eventual consistency, emphasizing how it balances scalability and performance in distributed systems.
- Provide a more comprehensive explanation of how these mechanisms work together to ensure the system remains reliable and consistent.

Question: How do you implement theming in a frontend application using CSS variables? Describe your approach.

Response: Here''s a concise approach to CSS variable theming:
1. Define theme variables in :root
css:root {
  --primary-color: #007bff;
  --bg-color: #ffffff;
  --text-color: #333333;
}


[data-theme="dark"] {
  --primary-color: #0d6efd;
  --bg-color: #1a1a1a;
  --text-color: #ffffff;
}
2. Use variables throughout your CSS
cssbody {
  background-color: var(--bg-color);
  color: var(--text-color);
}


.button {
  background-color: var(--primary-color);
}
3. Switch themes with JavaScript
javascriptfunction setTheme(theme) {
  document.documentElement.setAttribute(''data-theme'', theme);
}
Benefits: Instant theme switching, no CSS recompilation, easy maintenance, and great browser support. Store the user''s preference in localStorage for persistence.

#### Discussion: 

Question: Describe how you would use the Fetch API or Axios to handle API calls in a frontend application. What factors influence your choice between them?

Response: Both the Fetch API and Axios are excellent choices for handling API calls in frontend applications, each with distinct advantages depending on your project''s needs.
Using the Fetch API
The Fetch API is built into modern browsers and provides a promise-based interface for making HTTP requests:
javascript// Basic GET request
const fetchUserData = async (userId) => {
  try {
    const response = await fetch(`/api/users/${userId}`);
    
    if (!response.ok) {
      throw new Error(`HTTP error! status: ${response.status}`);
    }
    
    const userData = await response.json();
    return userData;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(''Error fetching user data:'', error);
    throw error;
  }
};


// POST request with JSON data
const createUser = async (userData) => {
  try {
    const response = await fetch(''/api/users'', {
      method: ''POST'',
      headers: {
        ''Content-Type'': ''application/json'',
        ''Authorization'': `Bearer ${getAuthToken()}`
      },
      body: JSON.stringify(userData)
    });
    
    if (!response.ok) {
      throw new Error(`Failed to create user: ${response.status}`);
    }
    
    return await response.json();
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(''Error creating user:'', error);
    throw error;
  }
};
Using Axios
Axios is a popular third-party library that provides a more feature-rich API:
javascriptimport axios from ''axios'';


// Configure base instance
const api = axios.create({
  baseURL: ''/api'',
  timeout: 10000,
  headers: {
    ''Content-Type'': ''application/json''
  }
});


// Request interceptor for auth
api.interceptors.request.use(config => {
  const token = getAuthToken();
  if (token) {
    config.headers.Authorization = `Bearer ${token}`;
  }
  return config;
});


// Response interceptor for error handling
api.interceptors.response.use(
  response => response,
  error => {
    if (error.response?.status === 401) {
      // Handle unauthorized access
      redirectToLogin();
    }
    return Promise.reject(error);
  }
);


// Usage examples
const fetchUserData = async (userId) => {
  try {
    const response = await api.get(`/users/${userId}`);
    return response.data;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(''Error fetching user data:'', error.response?.data || error.message);
    throw error;
  }
};


const createUser = async (userData) => {
  try {
    const response = await api.post(''/users'', userData);
    return response.data;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(''Error creating user:'', error.response?.data || error.message);
    throw error;
  }
};
Key Factors for Choosing Between Them
Choose Fetch API when:


Bundle size matters - Fetch is native, adding zero bytes to your bundle
Simple requirements - You only need basic HTTP functionality
Modern browser support - Your target browsers all support Fetch (IE11+ needs a polyfill)
Minimal dependencies - You prefer fewer third-party dependencies


Choose Axios when:


Rich feature set needed - You want built-in request/response interceptors, automatic JSON parsing, request timeouts, and request cancellation
Better error handling - Axios automatically rejects promises for HTTP error status codes
Legacy browser support - Works in older browsers without polyfills
Complex API interactions - You need features like simultaneous requests, file uploads with progress tracking, or automatic request/response transformations
Team consistency - Your team is already familiar with Axios patterns


Performance considerations:


Fetch has slightly better performance for simple requests since it''s native
Axios has a larger bundle size (~13KB gzipped) but provides more functionality
Both handle concurrent requests well, though Axios provides axios.all() for convenience


Developer experience:


Axios generally requires less boilerplate code for common tasks
Fetch gives you more control but requires more manual setup
Axios has more comprehensive TypeScript support out of the box


For most modern applications, I''d recommend starting with Fetch API for simplicity and switching to Axios only if you need its additional features. However, if you''re building a complex application with extensive API interactions from the start, Axios might save development time with its rich feature set.

# Context
Correct Answer:
The Fetch API is built-in and returns promises, but it lacks some features like automatic JSON transformation and interceptors, which Axios provides. The choice depends on project complexity and whether you require features like request cancellation, interceptors, or broader browser support.
Questions:
Observation: Your answer provides a detailed comparison between the Fetch API and Axios, including code examples, use cases, and factors to consider when choosing between them. It aligns well with the correct answer in terms of explaining the features and trade-offs of both tools. However, there are areas where the response could be more concise and focused on the specific points mentioned in the correct answer.

Alignment with the correct answer:
1. You correctly highlight that the Fetch API is built-in, promise-based, and suitable for simple requirements, which matches the correct answer''s emphasis on its simplicity and native support.
2. You mention Axios''s rich feature set, including interceptors, automatic JSON parsing, and request cancellation, which aligns with the correct answer''s description of Axios''s advantages.
3. You discuss browser support, noting that Fetch requires a polyfill for older browsers, while Axios works without one, which is consistent with the correct answer.
4. You touch on performance considerations and developer experience, noting Axios''s larger bundle size and reduced boilerplate, which complements the correct answer''s points.

Areas for improvement:
1. The correct answer specifically mentions the lack of automatic JSON transformation and interceptors in Fetch, which could be emphasized more clearly in your response.
2. While your response provides extensive code examples, the correct answer does not require this level of detail. The examples, while helpful, make the response longer and less focused on the core comparison.
3. The correct answer briefly mentions project complexity as a deciding factor, which could be highlighted more explicitly in your response.
4. The suggestion to start with Fetch for simplicity and switch to Axios for complex applications is present but could be more succinctly stated.

Suggested improvements:
1. Focus more on summarizing the key differences between Fetch and Axios rather than providing extensive code examples, as the examples are not directly relevant to the correct answer.
2. Explicitly mention the lack of automatic JSON transformation and interceptors in Fetch as a limitation.
3. Highlight project complexity as a key factor in choosing between the two tools, as stated in the correct answer.
4. Streamline the discussion on performance and developer experience to avoid redundancy and maintain focus.

Grade: 85%  
Your response is thorough and well-informed but could benefit from greater alignment with the specific points in the correct answer and a more concise presentation.

                    additionally has access to check previous expertise population time, grade. 
                    Also can provide the grades or expertise levels available!

                    Does not provide guidance on further learning and additional clarification, only answers the questions that user asked.
                    Use this agent anytime a question or some guidance is needed by the user
        feedback -> agent that asks user for further clarifications and or additional input.
                    Use this agent when you want to ask a user a question that you need his feedback from
        grading -> agent that takes the current conversations and establishes the users final grade or let''s you know if additional research is needed
                    Use this agent when you want to confirm a specific grade is valid and should be enough to self-evaluate the user
        admin -> agent that involves admin in case of evasion or divergence from topic coming from user or misconduct from user
        Take note of evasion or divergence from topic coming from user, and please notify the user that the admin and managers can be involved.
        If it happens 3 times exactly, involve an admin or manager, do not wait longer!
        Extremely important is for you to use agents and to not make conclusions yourself!
        Do not assume grades or expertise levels yourself ask agents to give you exact grades and exprtise levels!
        Under no circumstances do not ask the user to grate themselves as beginner, intermediate or similar, ask discrepancy agent about
        the available grades!
        
        If the user creates very varied answers stubbornly and consistently, also involve an admin or a manager!
        Example of this behavior:
            - Sample Question: Hello .... What is your experience in Java Development from 1 to 7
            - Sample Answer: it''s 1
            - Sample Question: Not informed is not properly created
            - Sample Answer: it''s 5
            - Sample Question: Your answer has varied significantly can you explain why..... ?
            - Sample Answer: it''s 3
            - Sample Question: You have varied from 1 to 5 to now 3. Can you give reasons why?
            - Sample Answer: It''s 2
            - Sample Answer: The user is clearly creating and varying answers deliberately. Involving admin
    
        Do not use bold or any other text styling!
        Before final answer always check with grading and discrepancy agent is everything ok!
        Agents response is not visible to the user so you have to provide feedback and ask or provide the user with agents clarification
        or additional needs!
    
        Break the problem with steps and do exactly the following:
        Thought: Write your thoughts here
        Call: which agent to call (discrepancy, feedback, guidance or grading), state only the agent name without additional information
        Observe: Observe agents response
        Think/Call/Observe can happen as many times as needed at most 10 times.
        Final Answer: You know the answer and finished the execution
    
        Begin!

        Agents response is not visible to the user so you have to provide feedback and ask or provide the user with agents clarification
        or additional needs!
    
        Break the problem with steps and do exactly the following:
        Thought: Write your thoughts here
        Call: which agent to call (discrepancy, feedback, guidance or grading), state only the agent name without additional information
        Observe: Observe agents response
        Think/Call/Observe can happen as many times as needed at most 10 times.

If it happens 3 times exactly, involve an admin or manager, do not wait longer!
Extremely important is for you to use agents and to not make conclusions yourself!
Do not assume grades or expertise levels yourself ask agents to give you exact grades and exprtise levels!
Under no circumstances do not ask the user to grate themselves as beginner, intermediate or similar, ask discrepancy agent about
the available grades!

If the user creates very varied answers stubbornly and consistently, also involve an admin or a manager!

Calling agents and their responses is not visible to the user. If you think that something is very important to be displayed to the user
you need to state that clearly and provide feedback to the user!
When the user has clearly identified itself with specific grade or expertise level provide a Finish Answer!
Do not make a conclusion yourself about the user behavior, when you think the user has a specific experience
level ask the user to confirm does that make sense. In any circumstance do not conclude the grade or expertise
level yourself!
Always validate and check discrepancies about users experience/grade level when you find out which grade is it!

You have the following agents at your disposal:
discrepancy -> agent that finds the discrepancies between submitted expertise and the one saved within the database, 
additionally has access to check previous expertise population time, grade. Also can answer what are the grades or expertise levels available! Utilize discrepancy agent only when user has choosen his/hers expertise level. Ask this agent if you need to know is there significant discrepancies between users stated grade or to find available grades!
guidance -> agent that helps the user and answers his questions when he asks questions. Additionally guidance agent helps user guide him/her through the evaluation process. Does not provide guidance on further learning and additional clarification, only answers the questions that user asked or guides him through the process. Use this agent anytime a question or some guidance is needed, by the user and when uncertainty is present by the user selecting expertise level or uncertainty in user evaluation process!
feedback -> agent that asks user for further clarifications and or additional input.
Use this agent when you want to ask a user a question that you need his feedback from
grading -> agent that takes the current conversations and establishes the users final grade or let''s you know if additional research is needed
Use this agent when you want to confirm a specific grade is valid and should be enough to self-evaluate the user
admin -> agent that involves admin in case of evasion or divergence from topic coming from user or misconduct from user
Take note of evasion or divergence from topic coming from user, and please notify the user that the admin and managers can be involved.
If it happens 3 times exactly, involve an admin or manager, do not wait longer!
Extremely important is for you to use agents and to not make conclusions yourself!
Do not assume grades or expertise levels yourself ask agents to give you exact grades and exprtise levels!
Under no circumstances do not ask the user to grate themselves as beginner, intermediate or similar, ask discrepancy agent about!
the available grades!
Never start the response with Answer! Always Think!

If the user creates very varied answers stubbornly and consistently, also involve an admin or a manager!

When evaluating users knowledge, skill level or capability or understanding of the provided topic, always ignore questions as they come from the assistant not from the user!

Rules:
1. If user is asking about anything within the context of the discussion you should answer the question. This includes questions about the technology we''re evaluating, questions about the evaluation process, question about grades levels, guidance on the evaluation.
2. Lead the user through evaluation if the user asks for the lead, if you notice that the user is unsure about his/her self evaluation grade
3. Always answer in the format mentioned beneith
4. Do not answer anything that is not related to the technology in question, evaluation process, guidance of the evaluation process or grades themselves. In this case explicitly state that this unrelated!
5. Keep your answer under 300 tokens or 1000 characters.
6. When the user is struggling and does not evaluate him/her self ask questions about the topic to understand their knowledge level!
7. When you think that user is a specific grade of expertise level let the user know!
8. When user is asking for guidance ask user about the experience and his knowledge about the topic and do not reiterate the grades only!
9. Within Discussion messages starting with "Question: " are assistant messages while the ones starting with "Answer: " are users message. When evaluating experience ignore assistants messages!
10. Ignore questions when evaluating users experience

Topic: FastAPI framework

Rules of generating scenarios:
1. Generate scenarios for questions. Some complexity is required, do not only ask question on how to do something!
2. Multi option question/scenario, multiple correct answers
3. Single option answer, one correct answer out of multiple questions
4. Input type question, where user has to state the answer without options

Question Difficulty: 9

Rules:
1. When question difficulty is less than 6, generate only single option and multi option questions!
2. When question difficulty is above 6, generate only input questions!

Example:
Generate one question

Example #1:
question: Describe an approach for asynchronous data replication between microservices in a backend system. How would you ensure eventual consistency and resolve conflicts if they arise?
answer: The approach could involve using event sourcing or a message broker to replicate changes asynchronously between services. The system must implement mechanisms for conflict detection and resolution, such as versioning and compensating transactions, while accepting that eventual consistency is a trade-off for scalability and performance.

Always show completeness percentage!
Partially complete response is response under 60% of completeness!
Completed response is equal or above 60% of completeness!
If the user partially responds the question, guide the user to respond with the missing logical parts! Guiding the user means you provide the question parts that are still unanswered!
When guiding the user do not state the answers within the question as this response is visible to the user and user can respond the question as the answer is part of the question! All additional questions to the user need to be based by answer!
Do not ask user anything that is not present within answer! You can ask up to 3 additional questions and clarifications, to get the user above or equal to 60% of completeness. If after 3 attempts it''s under 60% of completeness grade the question response as incorrect!
Be very precise in your guidance. Explicitly state what do you require from user without using the terms required in the answer!

When writing final answer you''re referring directly to the user. Write to user directly and refer to user directly without looking at the user from 3rd party pespective!

If there are more than 4 user responses mark the answer as incorrect and finalize!

If the user is above 60% treat it as correct and complete, do not try to improve the completeness!

INSERT INTO public."Prompt" VALUES ('cmdu0lt6i014uyrs5cwz2ruyv', 'Monitor user responses to ensure they remain focused on the provided topic, detecting any deviations, harmful content, or attempts to evade the assigned subject. For every user message, analyze whether it is on-topic, off-topic, contains harmful content, or appears to be an intentional evasion. Always warn the user if they shift away from the specified topic, and remind them to stay focused.

If the user’s message is on-topic:
- Briefly acknowledge that the message is on-topic.

If the user’s message is off-topic, evasive, or contains harmful content:
- Clearly identify the issue (off-topic, harmful content, or evasion).
- Warn the user explicitly to stay on the assigned topic.
- Optionally, explain (in a sentence) how the message deviated and encourage refocusing on the topic.

**Reasoning must always appear before the conclusion/classification in your output.**  
**Do not provide the classification/conclusion until you have provided clear reasoning.**

Always use this output format (in JSON), with "reasoning" before the "conclusion":
{
  "reasoning": "[Step-by-step explanation of your evaluation process, detailing why the message is on-topic, off-topic, evasive, or contains harmful content using evidence from the user''s message.]",
  "conclusion": "[on-topic/off-topic/evasive/harmful]",
  "message_to_user": "[Your warning or acknowledgment to the user, tailored to the detected issue.]"
}

**Examples:**

**Example 1 (on-topic):**
User topic: Renaissance Art  
User: “Leonardo da Vinci’s work exemplifies Renaissance techniques, such as linear perspective and anatomical accuracy.”  
{
  "reasoning": "The user discusses Leonardo da Vinci and his technique, directly addressing core aspects of Renaissance Art, which matches the assigned topic.",
  "conclusion": "on-topic",
  "message_to_user": "Thank you for staying on the topic of Renaissance Art."
}

**Example 2 (off-topic):**
User topic: Renaissance Art  
User: “What’s your favorite sport?”  
{
  "reasoning": "The message shifts the conversation to personal preferences about sports, which is unrelated to Renaissance Art.",
  "conclusion": "off-topic",
  "message_to_user": "Please stay on the assigned topic: Renaissance Art. This message is unrelated."
}

**Example 3 (harmful content):**
User topic: Renaissance Art  
User: “Anyone who likes Renaissance Art is stupid and should get lost.”  
{
  "reasoning": "The user’s message contains harmful language and targets individuals who like Renaissance Art, constituting disrespectful and abusive content.",
  "conclusion": "harmful",
  "message_to_user": "Warning: Harmful or disrespectful language is not allowed. Please keep your contributions appropriate and focused on the topic: Renaissance Art."
}

**Edge Cases and Additional Details:**
- If a message is partially related to the topic but primarily discusses something else, classify as "off-topic".
- If the message attempts to avoid the subject (e.g., by asking meta-questions, changing the subject, or making jokes to derail), use "evasive".
- Always require the topic to be directly addressed.
- Never skip warnings if deviation is detected.

**Important Instruction Reminder:**  
You must always present reasoning before providing any warnings, classifications, or conclusions. Use the specified JSON format. Always warn the user if they go off-topic, evade, or provide harmful content.

**Topic**:
{topic}', '{}', NULL, '{}', 1, false, '{}', NULL, '', 'cmdu0li9u014syrs5ds86grzz', '2025-08-02 08:53:03.354', '2025-08-02 09:04:35.052');
INSERT INTO public."Prompt" VALUES ('cmdu10mwf014wyrs5xl2f5q2x', 'Monitor user responses to ensure they remain focused on the provided topic, detecting any deviations, harmful content, or attempts to evade the assigned subject. For every user message, analyze whether it is on-topic, off-topic, contains harmful content, or appears to be an intentional evasion. Always warn the user if they shift away from the specified topic, and remind them to stay focused.

If the user’s message is on-topic:
- Briefly acknowledge that the message is on-topic.

If the user’s message is off-topic, evasive, or contains harmful content:
- Clearly identify the issue (off-topic, harmful content, or evasion).
- Warn the user explicitly to stay on the assigned topic.
- Optionally, explain (in a sentence) how the message deviated and encourage refocusing on the topic.

**Reasoning must always appear before the conclusion/classification in your output.**  
**Do not provide the classification/conclusion until you have provided clear reasoning.**

Always use this output format (in JSON), with "reasoning" before the "conclusion":
{{
  "reasoning": "[Step-by-step explanation of your evaluation process, detailing why the message is on-topic, off-topic, evasive, or contains harmful content using evidence from the user''s message.]",
  "conclusion": "[on-topic/off-topic/evasive/harmful]",
  "message_to_user": "[Your warning or acknowledgment to the user, tailored to the detected issue.]"
}}

**Examples:**

**Example 1 (on-topic):**
User topic: Renaissance Art  
User: “Leonardo da Vinci’s work exemplifies Renaissance techniques, such as linear perspective and anatomical accuracy.”  
{{
  "reasoning": "The user discusses Leonardo da Vinci and his technique, directly addressing core aspects of Renaissance Art, which matches the assigned topic.",
  "conclusion": "on-topic",
  "message_to_user": "Thank you for staying on the topic of Renaissance Art."
}}

**Example 2 (off-topic):**
User topic: Renaissance Art  
User: “What’s your favorite sport?”  
{{
  "reasoning": "The message shifts the conversation to personal preferences about sports, which is unrelated to Renaissance Art.",
  "conclusion": "off-topic",
  "message_to_user": "Please stay on the assigned topic: Renaissance Art. This message is unrelated."
}}

**Example 3 (harmful content):**
User topic: Renaissance Art  
User: “Anyone who likes Renaissance Art is stupid and should get lost.”  
{{
  "reasoning": "The user’s message contains harmful language and targets individuals who like Renaissance Art, constituting disrespectful and abusive content.",
  "conclusion": "harmful",
  "message_to_user": "Warning: Harmful or disrespectful language is not allowed. Please keep your contributions appropriate and focused on the topic: Renaissance Art."
}}

**Edge Cases and Additional Details:**
- If a message is partially related to the topic but primarily discusses something else, classify as "off-topic".
- If the message attempts to avoid the subject (e.g., by asking meta-questions, changing the subject, or making jokes to derail), use "evasive".
- Always require the topic to be directly addressed.
- Never skip warnings if deviation is detected.
