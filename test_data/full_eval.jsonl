I didn't know about those debugging capabilities. Maybe Spring Boot isn't as opaque as I thought."}, {"msg_type": "ai", "message": "Exactly! Spring Boot's transparency tools are quite powerful once you know about them. Your systematic approach to understanding application behavior would actually serve you well with Spring Boot.\n\nI'm recording your current level as **Informed Basics** for Spring Boot, but with your Spring expertise and architectural mindset, you'd likely advance to Level 4 or 5 quickly once you start hands-on work. Your concerns show the kind of thinking that leads to robust production applications."}]}

This will guide our discussion and help you gain the most from it!"}, {"msg_type": "human", "message": "Wait, I'm a backend developer. Why do I need to know about design tools? This seems irrelevant to my work."}, {"msg_type": "ai", "message": "I understand your perspective! As a backend developer, design tools might not seem directly relevant to your daily work. However, many modern development workflows involve cross-functional collaboration where understanding design tools can be valuable:\n\n- Reviewing UI specifications and understanding design handoffs\n- Collaborating with designers on API requirements\n- Understanding user experience implications of backend decisions\n- Contributing to design systems or component libraries\n\nThat said, if you truly have no interaction with design tools, that's perfectly valid information for your skill matrix. Have you ever needed to reference designs in Figma, or do you work completely independently of the design process?"}, {"msg_type": "human", "message": "Well, our designers do share Figma links sometimes when they need specific API endpoints or data structures. I usually just look at the designs to understand what data they need."}, {"msg_type": "ai", "message": "That's actually more relevant than you might think! Understanding how to navigate Figma to extract technical requirements shows basic tool familiarity. When you look at these Figma designs, do you just view the final designs, or do you also look at components, inspect design specs, or review prototypes?"}, {"msg_type": "human", "message": "I mostly just look at the designs to see what fields are needed and how the data flows. Sometimes I check the prototype to understand the user journey. I don't really edit anything or understand the design features."}, {"msg_type": "ai", "message": "That sounds like **Informed Basics** (Level 2) for Figma! You're using the tool for its intended collaborative purpose - extracting technical requirements and understanding user flows. You don't need to be a designer to have valuable Figma skills.\n\nThis kind of design-developer collaboration is actually quite important for building better APIs. Do you find the Figma prototypes helpful for understanding the backend requirements?"}, {"msg_type": "human", "message": "Actually, yes. Seeing the user flow helps me understand why certain API calls are needed and how to structure the responses efficiently. I never thought of that as a 'skill' though."}, {"msg_type": "ai", "message": "That's absolutely a skill! Design-informed backend development is becoming increasingly valuable. Your ability to translate design requirements into technical solutions shows good cross-functional collaboration.\n\nI'm recording your level as **Informed Basics** for Figma Design Tools. Even as a backend developer, you're using Figma effectively for technical collaboration, which is exactly how many successful development teams operate."}]}

I downloaded Unity a few months ago and followed some YouTube tutorials. I made a simple 2D platformer and a basic first-person shooter tutorial."}, {"msg_type": "ai", "message": "That's awesome! Game development is such a rewarding field. Creating a 2D platformer and FPS tutorial shows you've gotten hands-on experience with Unity's core systems.\n\nTo help assess your level, can you tell me more about what you implemented in these projects? Did you work with physics, animations, UI systems, or scripting game mechanics?"}, {"msg_type": "human", "message": "In the platformer, I used Unity's 2D physics for the character controller, created animations for running and jumping, and made collectible coins with simple scripts. The FPS tutorial covered mouse look, movement, and basic shooting mechanics. I wrote the scripts in C#."}, {"msg_type": "ai", "message": "Great! You've worked with several fundamental Unity systems - physics, animation, scripting, and basic game mechanics.
