Same thing with databases, I guess.""}], ""guidance_amount"": 0, ""next"": []}","your response shows a superficial understanding based on an incorrect analogy. while book indexing and database indexing share the concept of organization, database indexing creates data structures that improve query performance by providing faster access paths to table data. your oversimplified comparison misses the technical complexity and performance implications of database indexes. completeness level: 15%."
"{""model"": ""gpt-4o"", ""question_id"": 6, ""question"": ""What is polymorphism in OOP?"", ""answer"": ""Polymorphism allows objects of different types to be treated as instances of the same type through a common interface.
